# Learn Quantum Materials

### Who is this for?
It is intended to be used by instructors (or for self-study) at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level.

### Do I need to purchase any software?
Occasionally, some tutorials will incorporate software that requires a paid license. In those cases, alternative guides will be provided for those that do not have access to the code. For example, [ABINIT](https://www.abinit.org/) will be used as a free alternative to [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/).

### Can I run everything on my own computer?
Unfortunately, some of the the computations will likely be too expensive to run on a personal machine. In those cases, output files required to analyze the data will be provided as part of the tutorial. 
*Note: this series was designed as more of a pedagogical tool. If you are a student at a university, get in touch with a faculty member! You might be able to access a computing cluster.*

### Where do I start?
More details to come soon!
