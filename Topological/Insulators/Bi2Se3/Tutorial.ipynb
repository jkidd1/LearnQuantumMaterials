    "In classical mechanics, Noether’s theorem tells us that symmetries imply conservation laws. For example, if a Lagrangian is invariant under rotation, then angular momentum is conserved. In quantum mechanics, we are also interested in studying how certain features of a system are affected by physical transformations. The first transformation that we usually encounter when learning quantum mechanics is time evolution, where we ask, “what happens to a quantum state as time goes forward?” Time evolution is one example of what we generally call a **symmetry transformation**: for any two states $|x\\rangle$ and $|y\\rangle$, the transition probability between them is unaffected by the transformation, i.e.,\n",

    "\n",
    "Furthermore, **Wigner’s theorem** tells us that all symmetry transformations are either *unitary*, $$\\left\\langle\\widetilde{x}\\middle|\\widetilde{y}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle x\\middle| y\\right\\rangle,$$ or *anti-unitary*, $$\\left\\langle\\widetilde{x}\\middle|\\widetilde{y}\\right\\rangle=\\left\\langle y\\middle| x\\right\\rangle.$$ "

    "Next, we consider a specific symmetry transformation known as *time reversal*. As the name suggests, time reversal affects time evolution by reversing the direction of time, which changes quantities like momentum but leaves quantities like position unchanged (for a more rigorous explanation, see a standard quantum mechanics book like [Sakurai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Quantum_Mechanics)). Symmetry transformations also preserve the canonical commutation relations for position/momentum, $$\\left[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}\\right]=i\\hbar,$$ and spin, $$\\left[{\\hat{S}}_i,{\\hat{S}}_j\\right]=i{\\hbar\\epsilon}_{ijk}{\\hat{S}}_k.$$"

If a system of spin-1/2 particles (like electrons) is invariant under time reversal (formally, $\\left[\\hat{H},\\hat{T}\\right]=0$ where $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian and $\\hat{T}$ is the time reversal operator), then every energy eigenstate $|\\psi\\rangle$ transforms in such a way that $|\\widetilde{\\psi}\\rangle$ is a different state with the same energy.\n",

    "two systems are topologically equivalent if and only if they have the same number of filled energy levels.

Because it is an insulator with time reversal symmetry, it turns out that the topology can be characterized by studying its Kramers pairs. The algorithm that we will use was first developed by Soluyanov and Vanderbilt in 2011 (PRB 83, 235401).  It relies on the properties of Wannier functions, which will not be explained here for the sake of brevity.

To accomplish this, we use a modified version of VASP that was written to be compatible with Wannier90 (in VASP, this is known as the W90 “library mode”). We first read the `WAVECAR` using the `ISTART` tag, then pretend to do a DFT calculation while not actually taking any electronic steps (this is done by setting `NELM` to 0). We also include some tags that instruct VASP on which Bloch states and trial orbitals to consider in the calculation. \n",

Disentanglement ensures that the resulting energy spectrum is smooth and matches the DFT band structure as closely as possible for higher bands. For more a more detailed explanation, see PRB 56, 12847 (1997). Here are the settings:\n",

The script `hwcc.py` has already been provided for you, so all you need to do is submit the job. It will take about 5 minutes.\n",
    "2. Open the `invariant` file. For materials in the symmetry class of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, there are two unique topological invariants. The strong invariant is given in line 1, while the weak invariant* is given in line 2. This result tells us that Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is a strong topological insulator. We will also verify it ourselves. **There are technically three weak invariants, but for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, symmetry under exchange of crystal axes forces them to all be equal.*\n",

In this case, degeneracy is only guaranteed at the endpoints. The idea is to check whether the states at $k = 0$ have “switched partners” compared to those at $k = 1$. The algorithm is as follows: for a given surface, draw a horizontal reference line. If the HWCCs cross the line an odd (even) number of times, then the Z2 invariant on that surface is 1 (0). For $k_x = 0$, the line is crossed once near $k = 0.05$. For $k_x = 0.5$, the line is never crossed. "

Enter `6_hwcc_auto`. In the input folder, we will prepare VASP input files as though we were doing a band structure calculation, but with a few changes. First, copy the `INCAR`, `POSCAR`, `POTCAR`, and `CHGCAR` from `2_bands`. Notice that the `KPOINTS` file is not copied.

Z2Pack uses extremely strict convergence criteria when determining the final topological invariant and will add more points if necessary. As long as the calculation converges (which can be checked in the output file), we can usually be quite confident in the result. Hence, we are now using the default value of 10 initial k points. These parameters are controlled in the `hwcc.py` script. You can take a closer look at the details if you are interested in studying topological materials in the future. For now, submit the job, and it should converge in about 16 minutes.\n",
